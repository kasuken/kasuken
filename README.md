# Hi, I'm Emanuele 👋 🏊🚴🏃 💻

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0nica/M0nica/master/gh-header-image-cropped.png" alt="Emanuele Bartolesi - software engineer, content creator and community organizer">

I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. I recently was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the React ecosystem led me to launch <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
